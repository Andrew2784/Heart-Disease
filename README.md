# Project Description
The purpose of this project was to investigate the relationship between several variables such as age and cholesterol levels and whether a person has heart disease. The data was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository at this link: https://doi.org/10.24432/C52P4X. More information regarding the dataset can be found in that link and in the heart+disease folder.

The first part of the project involved cleaning the data so that it would be ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. Once the data was cleaned, EDA was performed to look at the data in more detail. The data revealed different relationships on several variables that are linked to heart linked such as maximum heart rate during exercise and some variables were not linked to heart disease such as cholesterol levels.

The second part of the project involved using machine learning algorithms including K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and random forest classifiers to predict whether a person has heart disease based on several variables. Each machine learning algorithm performed reasonably well at making predictions.

Overall, I enjoyed this project and learned much more about EDA and machine learning by working through it. In the future, I will likely continue to expand my data science skills and perform a more in-depth analysis on a more messier dataset. I am sure I will continue to learn more and I am excited for future projects.
